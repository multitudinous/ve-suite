Dependencies
OpenGL Performer (3.1.1) - http://sgi.com/software/performer/ VTK (4.4)
- http://vtk.org/get-software.php#interim
VRJuggler (2.0alpha4) - vrjuggler.org
VRJuggler dependences zip file
Java 2 SDK
omniORB (4.0.4) - http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/
cmake (2.0.2) (used to build vtk) -

This is our initial port of our app (VE_Suite) to windows.
Currently it must be built in Visual Studio 7.1(2003).
To set up the build environment:
1) edit the batch file to reflect your environment:
./VE_Installer/vesuite.OMNIBUILD.setup.bat
2) run the batch file: ./VE_Installer/vesuite.OMNIBUILD.setup.bat
This will set the proper environment variables and launch a session of
Visual Studio w/ the VE_Suite project loaded. The project should be
ready to build!
Currently the only two configurations are Debug_OMNI and Release_OMNI.
To run the solution from w/in Vis Studio, change the working directory
in the Configuration Properties tab to point to the directory where
your parameter files are. You will also need to pass in your config
files as command arguments on the configuration properties tab.
NOTE: Paths on windows SHOULD NOT contain spaces!!!!
Example:
BAD!!!!!
set VTK_HOME=C:\Documents and Settings\user\Desktop\vtk
GOOD!
set VTK_HOME=C:\vtk
Things needed:
OpenGL Performer version 3.1.1 VTK version 4.4
Cmake version 2.0.2
Omni-Orb version 4.0.3
Java2 version j2sdk1.4.2_04
Juggler 2.0 alpha4.win32-vc71
Juggler 2.0 alpha4.win32-vc71-deps
Here is a list of things that I had to do to get the program to
compile: The file &#8220;vtkConfigure.h&#8221; had to be moved from $(VTK_HOME) to
$(VTK_HOME)/common. I had to upgrade from my version of OpenGL
Performer 3.1 to the current Performer version (OpenGL Performer
3.1.1). The free unzip utility I have did unzip the nightly tar ball (a
zipped collection of all the VE_Suite files necessary to install), but
didn&#8217;t make the correct directory structure for them to be compiled. I
unzipped the files on Irix and moved them onto my laptop. When I
installed VTK, the directions tell you to put the files created into a
directory, and suggest calling it VTKbin. To get VE_Suite to compile, I
had to move the &#8220;bin&#8221; directory from this VTKbin directory to the main
VTK directory (the directory VTK unzipped itself into.) Talking to Dr.
K, he seems to think that the best way to have handled that was to put
those files in the main VTK directory. For some reason, the nightly tar
ball was missing some of the .java files from
$(VE_SUITE_HOME)/VE_Conductor/java_stuff. To compile this, I copied the
contents of the TSVEG/VE_Suite_Nightly/VE_Conductor/java_stuff
directory (on VRACS001) into $(VE_SUITE_HOME)/VE_Conductor/java_stuff,
and it worked. All of this got the programs to compile. To get them to
run, I did this: With the three projects still open, I right-clicked on
the VE_Xplorer project file, and selected properties. In the command
arguments section, I added:
$(VJ_BASE_DIR)\share\vrjuggler\data\configFiles\sim.base.jconf
$(VJ_BASE_DIR)\share\vrjuggler\data\configFiles\sim.wand.mixin.jconf
and I changed the working directory to $(VE_SUITE_HOME)\VE_TestSuite.
This allows the program to run while I am local (connected through the
VRAC fileservers.) When I try to run the code at home, it doesn&#8217;t work
(I think I&#8217;m having the same problems as you were at home, Gerrick.)
Anyway, hopefully this will help with the instructions. I&#8217;m going to
clean out my VE_Suite stuff again and try to build it again, trying to
keep better track of what I had to do step by step later.
