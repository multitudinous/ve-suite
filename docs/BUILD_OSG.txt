Building OpenSceneGraph on a UNIX style platform
================================================
   OpenSceneGraph is dependent on Producer and OpenThreads. Producer is
dependent on OpenThreads, therefore OpenThreads must be built first.
To build OpenThreads, go into the OpenThreads directory. The following
environment variables should be set either on the command line
(or through a setup script):

OSG_HOME ==> the location of the OpenSceneGraph directory
OPENTHREADS_INC_DIR ==> the location of OpenThreads/include
OPENTHREADS_LIB_DIR ==> the location of OpenThreads/lib
PRODUCER_INC_DIR ==> the location of Producer/include
PRODUCER_LIB_DIR ==> the location of Producer/lib
INST_LOCATION ==> this is where to install the libraries.

   These will all be specific to where you downloaded and extracted each
dependency directory.

To set these environment variables from the command line type something
like:

>setenv OSG_HOME /home/users/myaccount/ve_depends/OSG/OpenSceneGraph 

   After setting the environment variables are set, go into the OpenThreads
directory and type:
>make 
or
>gmake

This will compile OpenThreads.

Once it is built, install the libraries using:
> make INST_LOCATION=/home/myInstallDirectory/OSG install

where /home/myInstallDirectory is the desired directory to create the install.

Next go into the Producer directory:
>cd Producer
>gmake
>gmake INST_LOCATION=/home/myInstallDirectory/OSG install 

And finally:
>cd OpenSceneGraph
>gmake
>gmake INST_LOCATION=/home/myInstallDirectory/OSG install 

Check to see that libraries and headers are created in INST_LOCATION properly.
