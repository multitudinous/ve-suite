<p class="style1">The code is rough, so the operations have to be very specific for everything to work properly. </p>
<p class="style1">- Start by making a file (say locations.dat) in the working directory for the application </p>
<p class="style1">- Add a block 14 to the parameter file with the view points file name on the next line<br>
(the vrxpr.param.example should be good now)</p>
<p class="style1"> -Start the app running and when a chosen point has been found, select Add View Point <br>
on the View Points tab. Continue this until you have found all of the view points you would like <br>
to store, 
then click Write Points to File. </p>
<p class="style1">- Currently the GUI isn't set up to dynamically display new points when read in from the file, <br>
so in order to see your stored points in the selection box you will have to restart the app. </p>
<p class="style1">- At this point you should be in good shape to move around to the different points. <br>
To do this simply select the desired point in the selection box and click the Move button. </p>
<p class="style1">- A major flaw comes in with loading new points into a file with existing points. Right now, <br>
if you have file with existing points and find new points that you want to store, you will have to <br>
manually copy the previously stored locations out of the file before writing new points to the file, <br>
because the old points will be overwritten. After writing the new points to the file, you can go <br>
back in and manually copy the previously stored points back into the file.</p>
