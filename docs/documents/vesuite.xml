    <title>Introduction to VE-Suite</title>

    <para>VE-Suite is an open source toolkit that enables virtual engineering
    analysis and design. This open source framework includes distributed
    computing, platform independence, extensibility for component models,
    support for a hierarchy of component models, and comprehensive graphics
    capabilities, including support for immersive facilities.</para>

    <para>VE-Suite is a software package built upon VRJuggler &lt;link&gt;,
    Open Scene Graph&lt;link&gt;, Kitwareâ€™s Visualization ToolKit
    (VTK)&lt;link&gt;, CORBA compliant libraries (ACE/TAO)&lt;link&gt;, and
    wxWidgets&lt;link&gt;. Initially developed as a CFD visualization package,
    VE-Suite has matured into a software toolset which enhances engineers
    decision making capabilities. By integrating computational results from
    multiple disciplines into a common framework, VE-Suite helps the engineer
    analyze problems and make more complete solutions.</para>

      <title>Installation and Setup</title>

      <para>Installation of VE-Suite is fairly straight forward. Visit the
      Downloads &lt;link&gt; section and locate your OS. Two installers are
      provided for Windows which guide you through the process of selecting
      various options. One installer (vesuite.1.0.0.exe) contains the core
      VE-Suite binaries and .dll files. The other (vesuite_deps.1.0.0.exe)
      contains the binaries and .dll files of the dependencies for the current
      release of VE-Suite.</para>

      <para>On UNIX/Linux, two tar.gz files are provided for the core VE-Suite
      files and its dependencies.</para>

      <para>In either case, extracting the files creates two directory
      structures:</para>

      <para>VE_Suite.1.0.0/</para>

      <para>VE_Suite.1.0.0_Dependencies/</para>

      <section>
        <title>Windows Installation</title>

        <para>Installing VE-Suite and its dependencies follows the same
        procedure as other installations. You'll choose their locations, which
        components to install, their Start Menu folder, and whether to have a
        desktop icon.</para>

            <imagedata fileref="veimages/windowsinstall.png" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>Of particular note is which components to install. In large
        setups, certain computers will run the NameServer while others handle
        the Conductor and Xplorer. Since you're only running it on a single
        desktop, you'll want to install everything. Just leave all the
        checkboxes checked.</para>

        <para>Go through the same process for VE-Suite's dependencies.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>UNIX Installation</title>

        <para>On Unix, the installers are compressed tar.gz files. You can
        open them using these commands:</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Using GNU tar:</emphasis> gtar xvzf
        vesuite_1.0.1_RHEL_4.tar.gz gtar xvzf
        vesuite_deps1.0.1_RHEL_4.tar.gz</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Using gzip:</emphasis> gunzip &lt;
        vesuite_1.0.1_RHEL_4.tar.gz | tar xvf - gunzip &lt;
        vesuite_deps1.0.1_RHEL_4.tar.gz | tar xvf -</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Note</emphasis>: These examples use
        VE-Suite 1.0.1. Be sure to change the version number in the commands
        for later versions.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Setting the Runtime Environment</title>

        <para>In previous versions, VE-Suite's runtime environment was set
        through text scripts. Now it uses VE-Launcher to set up the
        environment. Most of it is automated, but you need to be aware of two
        important variables it sets: VE-Suite's directory and VE-Suite's
        Dependencies' directory.</para>

        <para>VE-Launcher automatically determines VE-Suite's directory from
        the current working directory. Moving the Launcher out of VE-Suite's
        directory or starting it from a different directory will pass the
        wrong value to VE-Suite, causing errors.</para>

        <para>The Dependencies directory is the only variable you need to set
        manually. The first time you start VE-Launcher, it will ask you to
        find the Dependencies directory. On Windows, it's simply the
        VE_Suite.1.#.#_Dependencies folder.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>On Unix/Linux, the dependencies folder holds one folder for each
        system supported. You need to choose your system's corresponding
        folder as the Dependencies folder.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>If you're upgrading from an earlier version of VE-Suite, you can
        also reset the Dependencies directory by clicking the Change
        Dependencies Folder button in VE-Launcher.</para>

        <title>Introduction</title>

        <para>Starting VE-Suite has been simplified with the release of
        version 1.0.0 via VE-Launcher. VE-Launcher is a quick, easy way to
        launch any configuration of VE-Suite. It helps you save your
        configuration, choose which programs to run, and launch them without
        entering text commands. Even with all of the options and
        configurations available, choosing the one you need can still take
        some work. Here, we explain how to use the Launcher and provide an
        example of setting it up.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>The Basics</title>

        <para>You start VE Launcher by double-clicking VE-Suite's desktop
        icon, double-clicking the velauncher program in VE-Suite's folder, or
        typing "python velauncher.py" into an Unix terminal. On your first
        time running VE-Launcher, it will ask you to choose the VE-Suite's
        Dependencies folder. On Windows, this folder is named
        VE_Suite.#.#.#_Dependencies.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>On Unix, the Dependencies folder contains folders for each
        system; you need to choose the one corresponding to your
        system.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>Once VE-Launcher confirms it's a dependencies folder, it will
        show you the main window.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para> * The Working Directory contains the files you want to load.
        Set it to the files' directory. * The Computation Engine Name and Port
        tell VE-Suite which computer and port to connect to. * The Launch Mode
        lists five modes you can launch VE-Suite in:</para>

        <para> 1. Desktop mode launches Conductor, Name Server, and Xplorer on
        your machine in Desktop mode. 2. Tablet mode launches Conductor. It's
        made for use on tablets. 3. Computation mode launches the Name Server.
        It's made for use on computational engines. 4. Visualization mode
        launches Xplorer. It's made for viewing projects. It uses Custom's
        settings to choose VR Juggler's configuration and which type of
        Xplorer to run. 5. New in 1.0.2: Shell mode lets the user work in a
        new shell with the VE-Suite environment set up. If you choose to
        launch in Shell mode, it'll ask you whether you want set up this shell
        for VE-Builder or not. If you do, it will add the VE-Builder directory
        you choose to the path. On Windows, launching Shell creates the shell
        in a window; simply close it to exit. On Unix, launching Shell makes
        the shell a child of your current terminal; type in "exit" to return
        to your original shell. 6. Custom mode lets the user choose their own
        settings. &lt;format&gt;</para>

        <para>The settings for every mode can be viewed and changed by
        clicking the Mode Settings button. Once you're done setting those,
        click the Launch VE-Suite button to close VE-Launcher and start
        VE-Suite.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">New in 1.0.2:</emphasis> The main window
        now has a menu bar with the following menus:</para>

        <para># File menu: * Open...: Pick a .ves or script shell file for
        launch. * Close Files: Remove any .ves or script shell files from the
        launch. * Quit # Configurations menu: * Load: Load a previously-saved
        configuration. * Save: Save the current configuration. * Delete:
        Delete a previously-saved configuration. &lt;format&gt;</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para># Options menu: * Choose Dependencies: Change the Dependencies
        directory. * Choose Builder Folder: Change the Builder directory. *
        Debug Level: Choose the debug levels passed to VE-Suite. * Cluster
        Wait Times: Customize the time VE-Suite waits between starting the
        master node and its slaves. &lt;format&gt;</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Mode Settings</title>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>You use the Mode Settings window to view and change settings.
        The Desktop, Tablet, and Computation modes only let you view their
        settings, while Visualization and Custom modes let you change some of
        them. Choices are faded out if you can't change them or if they
        wouldn't do anything. (For example, you can't choose which type of
        Xplorer to run if you're not running Xplorer.)</para>

        <para>Options you can set include: * Which VR Juggler configuration to
        use from the pulldown list. You can edit the list by clicking Edit
        Configuration List. We go into the List in more detail below. * Which
        programs to run. You can choose to run Name Server, Conductor, and
        Xplorer. If you don't select any of them, VE-Suite won't launch (since
        it won't do anything without a program to launch). * Whether to run
        Conductor and Xplorer in Desktop Mode. This checkbox is disabled if
        you're launching neither Conductor nor Xplorer. * Which type of
        Xplorer to run. OpenSceneGraph and OSG Patented will work for most
        projects, while OSG Patented Cluster is made for use on clustered
        computers. This radio list is disabled if you aren't launching
        Xplorer. &lt;format&gt;</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Edit Configuration List</emphasis></para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>VE-Suite has over two dozen configuration files available. To
        help you keep track of them, VE-Launcher provides you with a
        configuration list you can add, rename, and delete entries from. The
        path to the currently selected entry is listed below, so you can tell
        which name stands for which file.</para>

        <para>When you add a new configuration to the list, its initial name
        is its file name. You'll want to rename it to something more
        descriptive.</para>

      <section>
        <title>UNIX Clusters</title>

        <para>VE-Launcher versions 1.0.2+ have extra features for
        automatically starting up VE-Xplorer on other computers in a
        cluster.</para>

        <para>To use the cluster functions of VE-Launcher on Unix, your
        cluster must satisfy these requirements: 1. The path to VE-Suite, its
        dependencies, and the working directory is the same on every cluster
        node. 2. VE-Launcher's user has permission to ssh &lt;link&gt; to each
        node. 3. The user has manually sshed into each node and authenticated
        its name.</para>

        <para>The last requirement needs some explanation. The first time you
        ssh into an unknown host, you need to manually authenticate its name.
        If it isn't authenticated and VE-Launcher tries to connect to it, it
        will hang the program. Therefore, you must manually ssh into each node
        on the cluster (including your current computer) and authenticate it
        before you can start the cluster using VE-Launcher. You must use the
        exact name you'll use in VE-Launcher; ssh treats partially-qualified
        (francis) and fully-qualified (francis.iastate.edu) names as separate
        users. Once you authenticate the other nodes, the authentication stays
        in your user profile permentantly.</para>

        <para>Once you have all the nodes authenticated, you can run the
        cluster from VE-Launcher:</para>

        <para>1. If you're running NameServer or Conductor on a certain node,
        open VE-Launcher from that node. (VE-Launcher runs NameServer and
        Conductor from the current computer.)</para>

        <para>2. Set the settings. When you select the Xplorer type OSG
        Patented Cluster, the Set Cluster Computers button will be
        enabled.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>3. Click Set Cluster Computers. A window will pop up showing the
        master and slaves listed. Put the master's name in, then add each
        slave's name to the list. Click OK when you're done.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>4. Launch VE-Suite by clicking the Launch button. The cluster
        computers will start up VE-Suite.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Note:</emphasis> There's a slight delay
        between each node launched. That's because simultaneous launching
        caused erratic behavior in the cluster. The delay can be changed
        through the Options-&gt;Cluster Wait Times menu. If you're
        encountering problems with sync or unconnected nodes using
        VE-Launcher, try lengthening the delays. If it's taking too long to
        launch the cluster, try shortening them.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Windows Clusters</title>

        <para>VE-Launcher versions 1.0.2+ can start VE-Suite across a Windows
        cluster through PsExec &lt;link&gt;.</para>

        <para>To use the cluster functions of VE-Launcher on Unix, your
        cluster must satisfy these requirements: 1. The path to VE-Suite, its
        dependencies, and the working directory is the same on every cluster
        node. 2. PsExec &lt;link&gt; is installed on the computer you're
        running VE-Launcher on.</para>

        <para>To launch the cluster:</para>

        <para>1. If you're running NameServer or Conductor on a certain
        computer, open VE-Launcher from that computer. (VE-Launcher runs
        NameServer and Conductor from the current computer.)</para>

        <para>2. Select Custom mode and set your settings as usual. When you
        choose which Xplorer Type to run, select OSG Patented Cluster. This
        enables the Set Cluster Computers button.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>3. Click Set Cluster Computers. A window will pop up showing the
        master and slaves listed, plus an optional username field. Put the
        master's name in, then add each slave's name to the list.</para>

        <para>Some clusters might require you to connect as a certain user; if
        so, just enter your username into the User Name field. The username's
        domain may need to be included as well, depending on your cluster's
        setup. If you pass your username, you will have to manually enter your
        password in each Psexec window when it launchers; VE-Launcher doesn't
        send passwords for security reasons.</para>

        <para>Click OK when you're done.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>4. Launch VE-Suite by clicking the Launch button. The cluster
        computers will start up VE-Suite.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Note:</emphasis> There's a slight delay
        between each node launched. That's because simultaneous launching can
        cause erratic behavior in the cluster. The delay can be changed

        encountering problems with sync or unconnected nodes using
        VE-Launcher, try lengthening the delays. If it's taking too long to
        launch the cluster, try shortening them.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">The cluster template: </emphasis>If your
        cluster needs extra code to launch (for example, a net use command to
        set up a remote drive), you can enter the code into the
        clusterTemplate.txt file. Any terminal code in the clusterTemplate.txt
        file will run on the cluster's other computers before Xplorer is
        launched. Please read the comments in clusterTemplate.txt for more
        details.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Note: </emphasis>There is a bug in
        VE-Launcher 1.0.2 where the cluster template code isn't separated from
        the standard code by a line break. Be sure to put in a line break
        after the last line of code in the template to avoid errors from a
        merged line.</para>

        <title>Example</title>

        <para>John Doe wants to set up VE-Suite to look at a virtual power
        plant design. He needs to set it in Visualization mode, using the VR
        Juggler configuration "standalone" and the Open Scene Graph Xplorer.
        It also has to connect to computer kiwi on port 1239.</para>

        <para>When he starts VE-Launcher, he sees this:</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>First he types the path to the plant design data folder in the
        Working Directory field. (He could also use the Choose Working
        Directory button to find it.)</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>He needs to change the CE's name, but he can't because the
        Launcher's currently in Desktop mode, which automatically sets the
        CE's name to localhost. To unlock the CE's name, he switches to
        Visualization mode. (Any mode besides Desktop will let you change the
        CE's name.)</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>Switching modes unlocks the CE name and sets it to the last
        user-inputted value. Now John can change the CE name and port.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>To finish setting up the Launcher, John has to change the mode's
        settings. He clicks on the Mode Settings button to bring up the
        Settings window.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>Visualization mode sets most of the options, and Open Scene
        Graph is already selected. That just leaves changing the Xplorer
        configuration. The configuration he needs isn't on the list yet,
        though. John clicks the Edit Configuration List button.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>Since it isn't on the list, he adds it.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>It's automatically added to the list as standalone. John renames
        it to Plant Design so he can remember which project it's for.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>Now that he's done editing the list, John exits the Xplorer
        Configuration window. Since he had Plant Design selected when he left,
        it's automatically set as his current configuration file. With
        everything set as he wanted, John can now click Launch VE-Suite to
        look at the design.</para>

      <title>Running VE-Suite</title>

      <para>VE-Suite contains three programs you can run: the Naming Service,
      which allows you to connect to VE-CE; VE-Conductor, which provides the
      controls; and VE-Xplorer, which displays the scene. All three can be
      launched from VE-Launcher. The final step is connecting VE-Conductor to
      the naming server. This lets you process and manipulate the chosen
      dataset.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Starting VE-Suite</title>

        <para>VE-Launcher is the gateway to VE-Suite. To open VE-Launcher,
        Windows users should double-click the VE-Suite desktop icon or
        velauncher.exe in the VE_Suite folder. Unix/Linux users should go into
        the VE_Suite folder and enter:</para>

        <para>python velauncher.py </para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>If this is your first time running VE-Launcher, it will ask for
        the Dependencies folder (see Chapter 1.2&lt;link&gt;) before bringing
        you to the main window.</para>

        <para>The launcher has some advanced commands, but we can ignore them
        for now. Make sure Desktop mode is selected and click the Launch
        button. VE-Launcher will launch the Naming Service, VE-Conductor, and
        VE-Xplorer in Desktop mode.</para>

        <para>If you want to learn more about how to use VE-Launcher, check
        out the VE-Launcher guide here&lt;link&gt;.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Loading Data and Connecting</title>

        <para>VE-Suite loads objects through plug-ins. Here we will show you
        how to load a geometry file through a plug-in; other data files may be
        loaded in the same manner.</para>

        <para>You set up plug-ins through the "Available Objects" window on
        the right side of the screen. To create a new plugin, double-click on
        the red "Available Modules" folder, then double-click on the
        DefaultPlugin. A gray box will appear next to it. Right click on this
        box to access the plugin's menu. Select the "Geometry Config" option
        as shown.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>A new window will open on the design canvas, the CADTree
        Manager. This holds the objects you insert into your plugin. To select
        a geometry file, right-click on the Model_Geometry folder in the
        canvas and select Add Node-&gt;Load CAD file.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>Another window will appear. Choose the file's type, select the
        file, then click Open.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>The program will ask you to name the object you loaded, then
        insert it into the plugin. Add any other objects you want to include
        in the same way. Once this is completed, click Close on the design
        canvas.</para>

        <para>The information for the plug-in's node needs to be loaded to the
        rest of VE-Suite. This is done by choosing Submit job from the

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>The starting logo in VE-Xplorer should be replaced by the
        objects in the plugins you submitted.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>If the object is not initially found in the VE-Xplorer window,
        it may be outside the viewing region. If so, hold down the right mouse
        button and drag down in the VE-Xplorer window to pull back the camera;
        continue doing so until you can see the scene.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Navigation</title>

        <para>There are two ways to manipulate VE-Suite's view using just the
        mouse: dragging in the Xplorer window itself or using the Navigation
        Pane.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Xplorer Window</title>

          <para>If you have a 3-button mouse, you can do every translation and
          rotation within the Xplorer window itself.</para>

          <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

          <para>To rotate the scene, drag along the screen while holding the
          left button. To rotate along the X- and Z-axes, drag in the center
          of the screen. To rotate along the Y-axis, drag along the border of
          the screen.</para>

          <para>The right mouse button handles Y-axis translations. Hold the
          right button and drag the mouse up or down to push the scene away or
          pull it closer.</para>

          <para>The mouse wheel button handles the other translations. Hold it
          down to drag the scene left, right, up, or down across the
          screen.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Navigation Pane</title>

          <para>To open the Navigation pane, select Navigation Pane from the
          VE-Xplorer menu:</para>

          <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

          <para>The Navigation pane will appear below:</para>

          <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

          <para>Experiment with the movement buttons (the ones with arrows on
          them) to see how they change the scene. Note that they move the
          camera, not the object; clicking the left X-axis button, for
          example, will move the camera left, making the object shift
          right.</para>

          <para>Most of the other controls modify how the movement buttons
          act:</para>

          <para> * The Step Size sliders control the speed of translations and
          rotations. The farther to the right they are, the faster
          translations and rotations occur. * Rotate About Users Head controls
          how the camera reacts to Yaw Rotation commands. If it's checked, the
          camera rotates in place. If it isn't, the camera rotates around the
          environment center, like the roll and pitch rotations. * Reset Nav
          Position resets the camera to its initial position.

        <title>Quitting VE-Suite</title>

        <para>Ending your VE-Suite session takes two steps:</para>

        <para> 1. Select Quit from VE-Conductor's File menu. This quits
        Conductor and Xplorer. 2. Select the shell window running the Name
        Server. Close it or press Ctrl-C to break the program.</para>

      <title>Visualizations</title>

      <para>This chapter describes how to make visualizations using the
      VE-Suite toolkit and a sample dataset. If you want to follow this
      example, download and unzip the sample PrISUm car dataset: PrISUm.zip
      &lt;link&gt; (138MB)</para>

      <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

      <section>
        <title>Setup</title>

        <para>Visualizations requires two files: a geometry config file and a
        dataset file. Both have properties, such as scale and translation,
        that can be modified to ensure they line up.</para>

        <para>First, open VE-Launcher and set the working directory to the
        PrISUm folder. Next, open up VE-Suite in Desktop mode from
        VE-Launcher. Load the PrISUmblend.obj CAD file, but don't close the
        CADTree Manager window yet. (See Chapter 2.2) </para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>Right-click on the Model_Geometry folder again and choose
        Properties. A CAD Properties window will pop up. We can use this to
        change PrISUm's properties. We need to know what to change them to,
        though.</para>

        <para>Open the PrISUm folder from the desktop and look for the
        vrxpr.param file. This file contains parameter info for PrISUm, which
        we'll enter into the Properties window. Open it using a text editor,
        look for the 3x3 block underneath the number 9, and enter the values
        into the Properties window. Be sure to note the rows go in a different
        order in the Properties window than in the .param file:</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>Once the parameters are entered, close the CAD Properties and
        CADTree Manager window. Now right-click on our grey plugin box again
        and chose Data Set Config. We need to add the dataset to it.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>First, click Add Dataset to name your dataset configuration.
        Then click Open under DataSet Filename and choose the outFile3.vtk
        file as your dataset. You don't need to change any of the other
        settings for PrISUm, so just click Load to load the dataset and exit
        the window. </para>

        <para>Once that's done, choose Submit Job from the Connection menu to
        display the PrISUm car. Use the navigation pane to adjust the view
        until you get a good view of it.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Scalar Planes</title>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>Now that the plugin is set up, we can use the Visualization
        interface to show scalar planes, like the one above. Visualization not
        only lets you access scalar contours, but vector planes, isosurfaces,
        and more.</para>

        <para>To bring up the Visualization interface, right-click on the
        plug-in to access the menu and select Visualization. This window will
        appear:</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>Click on the Scalar Contours button (the leftmost icon) to bring
        up the Scalar Contours interface.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>Notice you can choose the plane's orientation and position. For
        now, set the Direction to Y and the plane's position to 50 and click
        Add Plane. This should appear on your screen: </para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>Once you're done looking at the contour planes, you can remove
        them from the screen by clicking Clear All on the Visualization
        interface. This will clear any Visualization features from
        VE-Xplorer.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Vector Planes</title>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>Showing vector planes is almost exactly like showing scalar
        planes. First, open up the Visualization interface again by
        right-clicking on the plug-in and selecting Visualization.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>This time, click on the Vector button (the 2nd-to-left icon) to
        open the Vector Contour window.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>The Vector Contour window is very similar to the Scalar Contour
        window. This time, set the Direction to Z and the plane's position to
        20 and click Add Plane. This should appear on your screen:</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>Just like the scalar plane, you can remove the vector plane by
        clicking Clear All on the Visualization interface.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Isosurfaces</title>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>To generate an isosurface, go back to the Visualization
        interface (right-click on the plug-in, select Visualization).</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>Before you can open the Isosurfaces window, you'll also need to
        choose a scalar or vector file. Choose scalars under Scalars and click
        the Isosurfaces button (the 3rd-from-right icon) to open the
        Isosurfaces window.</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>The Isosurfaces window only has one setting. Set the Isosurface
        pressure to 50 and click Compute Isosurface. This should appear on
        your screen:</para>

        <para>&lt;img&gt;</para>

        <para>Exit Visualization and examine the isosurface by using the mouse
        or the Navigation pane. Once you're done, reenter Visualization and
        click Clear All.</para>
