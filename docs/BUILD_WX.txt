Building wxWidgets on UNIX style platforms
==========================================
   To build wxWidgets, the library must be configured before it
can be built. This is platform specific. To do this first read the
INSTALL.txt file in the wxWidgets directory.
To configure wxWidgets properly for a VE-Suite build the following options
should be specified w/ the configure command:
--with-gtk=1  ==> this specifies which GTK version to link with
--enable-shared  ==> this creates shared libraries
--enable-log 
--prefix=/myInstallDirectory/wxGTK ==> this specifies the install directory

Following the instructions in INSTALL.txt, configure command would be:
>../configure --with-gtk=1 --enable-shared --enable-log --prefix=/

   This will setup wx properly for building w/ VE-Suite. When the configuration
is complete, type:
>gmake

After the build finishes type:
>gmake install
This will install the libraries and includes in the directory specified by
--prefix option.
