vtkActorToPF 6.7
----------------

Makefile:
  All you should have to do is make a soft link to the appropriate
  user.make:

  ln -s user.make.linux.vtk4 user.make

  Then edit user.make and set variable VTK to the directory containing vtk. 

  Note: If you are still using VTK 2.0, you will need to
    get an earlier version of vtkActorToPF. Send me an email.

Examples:
  Put a link to your vtkdata/ directory in the examples directory.
  Go into one of the subdirectories and type make.

Version History:
  Version 6.7 fixes a bug with scalar visibility and VTK 4.0. Thanks to
  Song Li for reporting this problem.

  Version 6.6 features support for VTK 4.0

  Version 6.5 features better Makefiles and faster compilation.

  Version 6.4 features support for texturing. See pfExamples/

  Version 6.3 features support for cell-data attributes (cell colors
  and cell normals).  See pfExamples/pfCellData.cxx. Thanks to
  Laura Threadgold for pointing out that this functionality was missing.

  Version 6.2 features vrJuggler examples and a vtk2pfb converter.

  Version 6.1 features a sproc() version of the parallel example. 
  The new version is a lot cleaner than the old, fork-based example. 

  Version 6.0 merges the regular and parallel versions of vtkActorToPF
  into one release.  In addition, it comes with many more examples and
  better error checking. It also come with code for a Performer loader
  DSO. The DSO is for loading static geometry stored in vtkPolyData
  files. It can be used in conjunction with "perfly".

  Version 5.1 contains some performance instrumentation. 
  Enable the output by using the "verbose" feature.

  Version 5.0 is a complete rewrite of vtkActorToPF.cxx. The old code 
  had evolved over several iterations and had become rather ugly. The
  new code is a lot cleaner and easier to follow.
  
  Note: vtkActorToPF 5.0 only creates non-indexed geosets. There are two
  major reasons for this:

    1) According to Performer documentation, non-indexed geosets render
       slightly faster.
    2) Indexed geosets in Performer use ushorts to store indices. This
       gives a hard limit of 65536 indices per geoset. Breaking up geometry
       into multiple indexed geosets would not be trivial due to sharing of
       vertices. By using non-indexed geosets, the translation is very simple
       and quick.

  Version 4.3 fixes a bug that caused seg faults with newer versions
  of vtk (vtk 2.4). Thanks to Per Ekman, Gordon Erlebacher, and 
  Tushar Udeshi for discovering this problem.

  Version 4.2 fixed polylines (line strips). Thanks to Josh Cantu
  for discovering this problem.
