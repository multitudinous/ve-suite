This directory contains six files representing different states of a transient
dataset:
   transient3scl_00.vtk  transient3scl_02.vtk  transient3scl_04.vtk
   transient3scl_01.vtk  transient3scl_03.vtk  transient3scl_05.vtk

Using the following script, precomputed plane data was created:

set index = 0
foreach file (*.vtk)
   echo ""
   mkdir -p precomputed_$index
   preprocessor $file precomputed_$index 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 5 0
   set index = `expr $index + 1`
end

Above script processes only planes, setting 1 x-plane, 0 y-planes, 5 z-planes,
with planes kept as separate entities

When the above script was run, six new directories were created, each containing the cutting planes specified in the shell script:
   precomputed_0
   precomputed_1
   precomputed_2
   precomputed_3
   precomputed_4
   precomputed_5
