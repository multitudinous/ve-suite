Get list of birds from VR Juggler for sensor proxys
Let the user choose the 3 birds that are attached to the buck
Let the user set the front, left rear, right rear birds
make a vector from the centroid of the resulting triangle to the front bird
make a vector from the centroid of the triangle to one of the rear birds
Do a cross product of the above two vectors to get the up vector
cross the up vector and the front vector to get the right vector
do the transform from the resulting coordinate system to the sip (mike will provide the transform)
Press a calibrate button to create the transform offset 
User will then remove all of the birds
Apply transform to the nav matrix just like it was an initial offsite in the nav keyboard
