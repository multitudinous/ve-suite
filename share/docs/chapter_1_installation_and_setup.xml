  <para>Support is provided at the following locations:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><ulink url="http://www.vesuite.org/forum/">VE-Suite Forums</ulink>
      - Users/developers can go here to access forums.</para>

      developers can view and submit bugs.</para>

  <para>Installation of VE-Suite is fairly straightforward. Visit the <ulink
  url="http://www.vesuite.org/download.php">Downloads</ulink> section and
  locate your operating system. Two installers, which guide you through the
  process of selecting various options, are provided for Windows. One
  installer, vesuite.x.x.x.exe, contains the core VE-Suite binaries and .dll
  files, while vesuite_deps.x.x.x.exe contains the binaries and .dll files of
  the dependencies for the current release of VE-Suite.</para>

  <para>On UNIX/Linux, two tar.gz files are provided for the core VE-Suite
  files and its dependencies. In either case, extracting the files creates two
  directory structures:</para>

  <para><code> VE-Suite.x.x.x/</code></para>

  <para><code> VE_Suite.x.x.x_Dependencies/</code></para>

  <section>
    <title>Windows Installation</title>

    <para>Installing VE-Suite and its dependencies follows the same procedure
    as other installations. You'll choose which components to install, their
    locations, their Start Menu folder, and whether to have a desktop
    icon.</para>

    </mediaobject>

    <para>Of particular note is which components to install. In large setups,
    certain computers will run the NameServer while others will handle the
    Conductor and Xplorer. If you only plan to run it on a single desktop,
    you'll want to install everything. Just leave all the checkboxes
    checked.</para>

    <para>Go through the same process for VE-Suite's dependencies.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="unix_installation">
    <title>UNIX Installation</title>

    <para>On Unix, the installers are compressed tar.gz files. You can open
    them using these commands:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Using GNU tar:</para>

        <para><code>gtar xvzf vesuite_x.x.x_RHEL_4.tar.gz </code></para>

        <para><code>gtar xvzf vesuite_depsx.x.x_RHEL_4.tar.gz</code></para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Using gzip:</para>

        <para><code>gunzip &lt; vesuite_x.x.x_RHEL_4.tar.gz | tar xvf
        -</code></para>

        <para><code>gunzip &lt; vesuite_depsx.x.x_RHEL_4.tar.gz | tar xvf
        -</code></para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">NOTE</emphasis>: These examples use
    vesuite_x.x.x as a general placeholder for any version of VE-Suite. Be
    sure to change the version number to the specific version you are
    installing.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="setting_runtime_environment">
    <title>Setting the Runtime Environment</title>

    <para>In previous versions, VE-Suite's runtime environment was set through
    text scripts. Now it uses VE-Launcher to set up the environment. Most of
    it is automated, but you need to be aware of two important variables it
    sets: VE-Suite's directory and VE-Suite's Dependencies directory.</para>

    <para>VE-Launcher automatically determines VE-Suite's directory from the
    current working directory. Moving the Launcher out of VE-Suite's directory
    or starting it from a different directory will pass the wrong value to
    VE-Suite, causing errors.</para>

    <para>The Dependencies directory is the only variable you need to set
    manually. The first time you start VE-Launcher, you will be asked to find
    the Dependencies directory. On Windows, it is the
    VE_Suite.x.x.x_Dependencies folder.</para>

    </mediaobject>

    <para>On Unix/Linux, the dependencies folder holds one folder for each
    system supported. You need to choose your system's corresponding folder as
    the Dependencies folder.</para>

    <para>If you're upgrading from an earlier version of VE-Suite, you can
    also reset the Dependencies directory by clicking the Change Dependencies
    Folder button in VE-Launcher.</para>
