  <para>Before attempting to build VE-Suite, be sure to build/install the
  dependencies (see Chapter 8, Dependencies) and set the environment (see
  Chapter 9, Setting the Environment).</para>

    <title>UNIX/Linux Build Instructions</title>

    <para>VE-Suite, as well as its dependencies, is currently being tested on
    a broad range of unix/linux platforms including: IRIX 6.5, SuSE, and
    RedHat Enterprise.</para>

    <para>Set the environment variables (see Chapter 9, Setting the
    Environment) and source the setup file included with the VE-Suite project:
    $(VE_SUITE_HOME)/VE_Installer/setup.{.sh,tsh}. Once this file has been
    properly edited, type <code>gmake</code>. The unix build system is based
    on Doozer which is included with VR Juggler.</para>

      <title>Debugging VE_Xplorer</title>

      <para>To run VE_Xplorer from within the Visual Studio debugger, change
      the working directory in the Configuration Properties tab to point to
      the directory where your VE-Suite parameter file is located (for
      example, change the working directory to
      $(VE_SUITE_HOME)VE_TestSuite).</para>

      <para>You will also need to pass in your VR juggler config files as
      command arguments on the configuration properties tab. With the two
      projects still open, right-click on the VE_Xplorer project file, and
      select properties. For simulation mode, you add the following to your
      command arguments section:</para>

      <para><code> $(VJ_BASE_DIR)sharevrjugglerdataconfigFiles sim.base.jconf
      </code></para>

      <para><code> $(VJ_BASE_DIR)sharevrjugglerdataconfigFiles
      sim.wand.mixin.jconf </code></para>

      <para>After you enter a parameter file name and the scene loads, double
      click on $(VE_SUITE_HOME)bin runWinClient.bat to bring up the
      gui.</para>
