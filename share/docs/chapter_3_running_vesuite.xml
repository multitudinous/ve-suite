  <title>Running VE-Suite</title>

  <para>VE-Suite contains three programs you can run: the Naming Service,
  which allows you to connect to VE-CE; VE-Conductor, which provides the
  controls; and VE-Xplorer, which displays the scene. All three can be
  launched from VE-Launcher. The final step is connecting VE-Conductor to the
  naming server. This lets you process and manipulate the chosen
  dataset.</para>

    <title>Starting VE-Suite</title>

    <para>VE-Launcher is the gateway to VE-Suite. To open VE-Launcher, Windows
    users should double-click the VE-Suite desktop icon or velauncher.exe in
    the VE_Suite folder. Unix/Linux users should go into the VE_Suite folder
    and enter:</para>

    <para><code> python velauncher.py</code></para>

    <para>If this is your first time running VE-Launcher, you will be asked
    for the Dependencies folder (see Chapter 1.3, Setting the Runtime
    Environment) before being shown the main window.</para>

    <para>Launcher has some advanced commands, but we can ignore them for now.
    Make sure Desktop mode is selected and click
    <guibutton>Launch</guibutton>. VE-Launcher will launch the Naming Service,
    VE-Conductor, and VE-Xplorer in Desktop mode.</para>

    <para>If you want to learn more about how to use VE-Launcher, read the
    <olink>VE-Launcher section</olink> of this guide.</para>

    <title>Loading Data and Connecting</title>

    <para>VE-Suite loads objects through plugins. Here we will show you how to
    load a geometry file through a plugin; other data files may be loaded in
    the same manner.</para>

    <para>You set up plugins through the "Available Objects" window on the
    right side of the screen. To create a new plugin, double-click the red
    "Available Modules" folder, then double-click "DefaultPlugin". A gray box
    will appear. Right-click on this box to access the plugin's menu. Select
    the "Geometry Config" option as shown.</para>

    <para>A new window will open on the design canvas, the CADTree Manager.
    This holds the objects you insert into your plugin. To select a geometry
    file, right-click on the "Model_Geometry" folder in the canvas and select
    Add Node-&gt;Load CAD file.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="veimages/loadingdata2.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>Another window will appear. Choose the file's type, select the file,
    then click <guibutton>Open</guibutton>.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="veimages/loadingdata3.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>The program will ask you to name the object you loaded, then insert
    it into the plugin. Add any other objects you want to include in the same
    way. Once this is completed, click <guibutton>Close</guibutton> on the
    design canvas.</para>

    <para>The information for the plugin's node needs to be loaded to the rest
    of VE-Suite. This is done by choosing "Submit Job" from the Connection
    menu.</para>

        <imagedata fileref="veimages/loadingdata4.jpg" />

    <para>The starting logo in VE-Xplorer should be replaced by the objects in
    the plugins you submitted.</para>

      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>If the object is not initially found in the VE-Xplorer window, it
    may be outside the viewing region. If so, hold down the right mouse button
    and drag down in the VE-Xplorer window to pull back the camera; continue
    doing so until you can see the scene.</para>

  <section id="navigation">
    <title>Navigation</title>

    <para>There are two ways to manipulate VE-Suite's view using just the
    mouse: dragging in the Xplorer window itself or using the Navigation
    Pane.</para>

    <section id="xplorerwindow">
      <title>Xplorer Window</title>

      <para>If you have a 3-button mouse, you can do every translation and
      rotation within the Xplorer window itself.</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="veimages/navigation1.gif" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>To rotate the scene, drag along the screen while holding the left
      button. To rotate along the X- and Z-axes, drag in the center of the
      screen. To rotate along the Y-axis, drag along the border of the
      screen.</para>

      <para>The right mouse button handles Y-axis translations. Hold the right
      button and drag the mouse up or down to push the scene away or pull it
      closer.</para>

      <para>The mouse wheel button handles the other translations. Hold it
      down to drag the scene left, right, up, or down across the
      screen.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="navigatio_npane">
      <title>Navigation Pane</title>

      <para>To open the Navigation pane, select "Navigation Pane" from the
      VE-Xplorer menu:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="veimages/navigation2.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>The Navigation Pane will appear below:</para>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="veimages/navigation3.jpg" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>

      <para>Experiment with the movement buttons (the ones with arrows on
      them) to see how they change the scene. Note that they move the camera,
      not the object; clicking the left X-axis button, for example, will move
      the camera left, making the object shift right.</para>

      <para>Most of the other controls modify how the movement buttons
      act:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The <emphasis role="bold">Step Size sliders</emphasis> control
          the speed of translations and rotations. The farther to the right
          they are, the faster translations and rotations occur.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Rotate About Users Head
          </emphasis>controls how the camera reacts to Yaw Rotation commands.
          If it is checked, the camera rotates in place. If it is not, the
          camera rotates around the environment center, like the roll and
          pitch rotations.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><guibutton>Reset Nav Position</guibutton> resets the camera to
          its initial position.</para>

    <para>Ending your VE-Suite session takes two steps:</para>

        <para>Select "Quit" from VE-Conductor's File menu. This quits
