    <title>Generate Documentation</title>

    <para>***For the time being, this applies only to linux builds*** In your
    OS terminal, navigate within VE-Suite to the file named
    <code>doxygen</code>, which will contain all of its doxygen files. The
    initial part of the filepath will depend on your install, but the end of
    it will be: &lt;VeSuite filename&gt;/share/docs/doxygen. To make sure that
    the configuration file exists, type "doxygen -g", then type "doxygen
    Doxyfile". This will generate documentation using the default settings. If
    you wish to create a differently named file to contain documentation
    settings, this can be accomplished with "doxygen -g &lt;filename&gt;" and
    "doxygen &lt;filename&gt;". The default in VE-Suite is Doxyfile.</para>

    <para>Open the "html" folder inside doxygen. Find the "index.html" file.
    You can click on it to open it in a browser and if you have run "doxygen
    Doxyfile". It will display a hierarchy of documentation for all your
    generated files.</para>

    <para>To edit the settings for the type of documentation that will be
    created when doxygen is run, read through the Doxyfile. Each variable is
    commented, and you can edit the values given to those variables in the
    Doxyfile.</para>
