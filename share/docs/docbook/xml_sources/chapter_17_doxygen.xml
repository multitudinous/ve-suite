    <title>Generate Documentation</title>

    <para>***For the time being, this applies only to linux builds*** In your
    OS terminal, navigate to the file within VE Suite named doxygen which will
    contain all its doxygen files. The initial part of the filepath will
    depend on your install, but the end of it will be: &lt;VeSuite
    filename&gt;/share/docs/doxygen. To make sure that the configuration file
    exists, type "doxygen -g", then type "doxygen Doxyfile", this will
    generate documentation using the default settings. If you wish to create a
    differently named file to contain documentation settings, this can be
    accomplished with "doxygen -g &lt;filename&gt;" and "doxygen
    &lt;filename&gt;". For the default in VE Suite, it is Doxyfile. </para>

    <para>Open the "html" folder inside doxygen. Find the "index.html" file.
    You can click on it to open it in a browser and (if you've run "doxygen
    Doxyfile") it will display a hierarchy of documentation for all your
    generated files.</para>

    <para>To edit the settings for the type of documentation that will be
    created when doxygen is run, read through the Doxyfile. Each variable is
    commented, and you can edit the values given to those variables in the
    Doxyfile.</para>
