    <para>VE-Launcher is a quick, easy way to launch any configuration of
    VE-Suite. It helps you save your configuration, choose which programs to
    run, and launch them without entering text commands. Even with all of the
    options and configurations available, choosing the one you need can still
    take some work. Here, we explain how to use the Launcher and provide an
    example setup.</para>

  <section id="starting_launcher">
    <title>Starting the Launcher</title>

    <para>On the Windows install, VE-Launcher is an executable. Double-click
    on it to start.</para>

    <para>On the Unix-based install, VE-Launcher is a python program. Go into
    VE-Suite's /bin directory and run velauncher.py. Specifically, from the
    command line, you can enter the /bin directory and type "python
    velauncher.py" to run the launcher.</para>

    <para>For both Windows and Unix-based development versions, VE-Launcher is
    a python program, just like with the Unix-based install. Run it in the
    same way as the Unix-based install. In dev mode, VE-Launcher does not
    require you to set dependencies and it looks for stereo desktop config
    files in their build location, not their install location.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Preset Environmental Variables:</emphasis>
    Certain values, such as the VPR_DEBUG_LEVEL, can be automatically passed
    into VE-Launcher from the environment when VE-Launcher starts. If they are
    set in the environment, they overwrite the values saved from previous
    VE-Launcher start. These variables include:</para>

    <title>Setting the Launcher's Dependencies</title>

    <para>Before VE-Suite can be run, VE-Launcher must be pointed to its
    dependencies. How this should be done depends on whether VE-Suite is being
    run on a Windows or a Unix-based system. Pointing to the dependencies is
    bypassed completely in Dev mode; VE-Launcher assumes the environmental
    variables have been set.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Windows:</emphasis> VE-Launcher needs to find
    the VE-Suite Dependencies directory that was installed along with
    VE-Suite. The first time the Launcher is started, the user is prompted to
    choose the Dependencies directory for it. This should be named
    VE_Suite.#.#_Dependencies. If the Dependencies directory needs to be
    changed later, it can be done from the Options-&gt;Choose Dependencies
    menu in VE-Launcher.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Unix:</emphasis> VE-Launcher supports
    dependencies spread across multiple directories. The first time the
    Launcher is started, it will ask you to choose its Dependencies'
    directories. Add each dependency's directory to the list.</para>

    <para>The only exception is VR-Juggler's dependency directory. Since it
    sets multiple variables, it needs to be chosen separately from the other
    dependencies.</para>

    <para>If the Dependencies directory needs to be changed later, it can be
    done from the Options-&gt;Choose Dependencies menu in VE-Launcher.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Shell mode lets the user work in a new shell with the
            VE-Suite environment set up. If you choose to launch in Shell
            mode, it will ask you whether you want to set up this shell for
            VE-Builder. If you do, it will add the VE-Builder directory you
            choose to the path. On Windows, launching Shell creates the shell
            in a window; simply close it to exit. On Unix, launching Shell
            makes the shell a child of your current terminal; type in "exit"

    <title>UNIX Clusters</title>

    <para>VE-Launcher can run VE-Suite across a cluster from one computer. To
    use the cluster functions of VE-Launcher on Unix, the cluster must satisfy
    these requirements:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The path to VE-Suite, its dependencies, and the working
        directory are the same on every cluster node.</para>

        <para>The user has manually sshed into each node and authenticated its
        host.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>The last requirement needs some explanation. The first time you ssh
    into an unknown host, you need to manually authenticate its name. If it is
    not authenticated and VE-Launcher tries to connect to it, it will hang the
    program. Therefore, you must manually ssh into each node on the cluster
    (including your current computer) and authenticate it before you can start
    the cluster using VE-Launcher. You must use the exact name you will use in
    VE-Launcher; ssh treats partially qualified (e.g., francis) and fully
    qualified (e.g., francis.iastate.edu) names as separate users. Once you
    authenticate the other nodes, the authentication stays in your user
    profile permanently.</para>

    <title>Example</title>

    <para>John Doe wants to set up VE-Suite to look at a virtual power plant
    design. He needs to start it in Visualization mode, using the VR Juggler
    configuration "standalone". It also has to connect to computer kiwi on
    port 1239.</para>

    <para>When he starts VE-Launcher, he sees this:</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="../veimages/Example1.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>First he types the path to the plant design data folder in the
    Working Directory field. (He could also use the <guibutton>Choose Working
    Directory </guibutton>button to find it.)</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="../veimages/Example2.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>He needs to change the computational engine (CE) name, but he can't
    because the Launcher is currently in Desktop mode, which automatically
    sets the CE name to "localhost". To unlock the CE name, he switches to
    Visualization mode. (Any mode besides Desktop will let you change the CE
    name.)</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="../veimages/Example3.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>Switching modes unlocks the CE name and sets it to the last
    user-inputted value. Now John can change the CE name and port.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="../veimages/Example4.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>To finish setting up the Launcher, John must change the mode's
    settings. He clicks the <guibutton>Mode Settings</guibutton> button to
    bring up the Settings window.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="../veimages/Example5.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>Visualization mode sets most of the options, and the Non-Cluster
    Xplorer mode is already selected. That leaves changing the Xplorer
    configuration. However, the configuration he needs is not on the list yet.
    John clicks <guibutton>Edit Configuration List</guibutton>.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="../veimages/Example6.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>Because it is not on the list, he adds it.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="../veimages/Example7.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>It is automatically added to the list with the name "standalone".
    John renames it "Plant Design" so he can remember which project it is
    for.</para>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="../veimages/Example8.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>Now that he is done editing the list, John exits the Xplorer
    Configuration window. Because Plant Design was selected when he left, it
    is automatically set as his current configuration file. With everything
    set as he wanted, John can now click <guibutton>Launch
    VE-Suite</guibutton> to look at the design.</para>
