## This is an extension file mapping that tells OSG to use
##   our PolyTrans loader for .asm, .prt, etc.
##
## In the future, this file could be loaded with an env var,
##   but for now the file must be loaded programmatically.
##
## To use this file, the application must explicitly tell OSG
##   to load it by making the following function call:
##       osgDB::Registry::instance()->readPluginAliasConfigurationFile( fileName );
##   where 'fileName' is the name of this file. The path to this
##   file must also be stored in OSG_FILE_PATH.

## Extension mapping:
prt PolyTrans
asm PolyTrans
igs PolyTrans
