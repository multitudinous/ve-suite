      <p> The 0-D gasifier model consists of two submodels: 
      a zonal equilibrium submodel with heat transfer and an optional coal 
      burnout submodel. The zonal submodel calculates the equilibrium exit gas 
      concentration and temperature given the calculated heat transfer through 
      the walls. An ash viscosity submodel from the CFD gasifier slag model is 
      used to calculate a representative ash viscosity and critical viscosity 
      temperature. The fuel burnout is required by the zonal submodel that may 
      be obtained from either the burnout submodel or simply specified as a user 
      input. If the geometry is input, the burnout is calculated by the burnout 
      submodel. If the desired burnout is specified by the user, the burnout 
      submodel is optional to determine the residence time and the geometry 
      needed to produce the input burnout. The gas and radiation temperatures 
      needed by the burnout submodel are obtained from the zonal submodel.  </p>

					The Gasifier Module's graphical <b>User Interface</b> is divided into&nbsp;two

					The first folder, <em>Flows</em>, allows the user to specify the injector 
					properties. The folder is organized such that each level of the three available 
					injectors is configured <b>separately.</b>&nbsp;Required fields include steam <EM>Temperature
					</EM>and <EM>Flowrate</EM> as well as slurry properties including <em>Temperature</em>,
					<em>Flowrate</em>, and <em>Percent Coal.</em>

				<p>The Gasifier module can be used to model either one stage or two stage 
					gasifiers. One stage gasifiers are typified by a single set of injectors 
					positioned in either a down flow (shown below) or upflow design. Two stage 
					gasifiers usually have two larger compartments separated by a necked center 
					section. Two stage gasifiers use two sets of injectors fired directly into each 
					of the larger compartments (shown at right).</p>
				<p>When the one stage type is specified, only the first injector of the <b>User 
						Interface</b> is active. When a two stage gasifier is selected, the user 
					must input values for each of the three injectors (see diagram at right). <img src="images/Gasifier_Schematic4.gif" vspace="20" hspace="20" align="center"></p>

					unselected, the <em>Design Mode</em> button is available where, if selected, 
					the user specifies the length over diameter ratio ( <em>L/D)</em> and the model 
					calculates the dimensions required to produce the specified&nbsp; <em>Burnout</em>.
