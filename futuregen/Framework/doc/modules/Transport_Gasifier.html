      <td><p>A transport reactor is an alternative gasifier concept that could potentially be used in a Vision 21 plant rather than an entrained flow gasifier. The transport reactor is in effect a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) with a high recirculation rate (i.e., high particle velocity). An example of a transport reactor gasifier is the KBR coal gasifier being used at the DOE Wilsonville facility. The CFD tools being used in this Vision 21 project to simulate the flow field of entrained flow gasifiers are not appropriate for modeling a transport reactor due to the dense particle loading encountered in the transport reactor. Hence, a different modeling tool is required. REI developed a computer model for CFB systems that can be extended for modeling a transport reactor gasifier. The model is based on a computer model originally developed in Europe with funding from the International Energy Agency (IEA). The original IEA model was designed to simulate coal combustion in an atmospheric or pressurized circulating fluidized bed. It uses a 1-½ dimensional steady-state model (annulus-core model), based on energy balance and species mass balance equations. The model includes sub-models for the riser, cyclone, return leg and the solids flow control valve. The model describes the reactor hydrodynamic behavior, reactions involved with coal combustion, emissions and sulfur dioxide removal, heat transfer, etc., including gas and solid flows, development of coal/char particle size distribution during combustion, coal conversion, homogeneous and catalytic gas reactions and heat transfer to the furnace wall. Reduction of sulfur dioxide using limestone/dolomite was also taken into account. The model predicts coal conversion, cyclone efficiency, temperature profile in the furnace and emissions of CO, CO2, NO, N2O and SO2 from the furnace. Detailed information regarding this model can be found in [Hannes, 1993].
In the model, the dense bed height is calculated iteratively based on a known pressure drop across the riser. The model requires the pressure drop across the riser as an input, and since most often this value is unknown, the model has been modified so that the riser pressure drop can be predicted once the solids circulation rate is known. 
In the modified model, the solids volume fraction in the dilute zone of the riser is assumed to be (Kunii and Levenspiel, 1991)

      <td> <p> The Transport Gasifier Module's graphical <b>User Interface</b> is divided into three folders.</p>
      <p>In the <em>Geometry</em> interface, the riser geometry of the gasifier can be specified by dragging a currently selected point after pressing the <em>Lock</em> icon (changing to <em>Unlock</em>).  Number of cyclones and cycone geometry can also be specified by entering data in the spaces on the right hand side of the window.  Inlet locations of coal feed and limestone feed should also be provided here.  Location of returning streams from the return leg and external heat exchangers are also specified.  Riser exit location should be given here.  Recycled flue gas can be specified as a percentage of recycle flue gas flow rate and air flow rate.  Icon <em>Normalize Flows</em> is used to normalize recycled flue gas and air flow rates so that the sum of the two streams is unity.  Number of computational cells between a currently selected point and a point above the selected point can be specified here.  It is recommended that uniform cell sizes are used along the riser.</p>
