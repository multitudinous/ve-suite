<p>This module makes use of the Nernst equation and equations for activation, concentration, and ohmic losses to calculate fuel cell electrical output. Thermodynamic calculations are performed using a combination of equilibrium and heat exchanger calculations. The anode temperature is iterated until the thermodynamic output from the fuel cell matches the electrical output. The model obtained from DOE-NETL was developed for use in Aspen-Plus and employed a combination of Aspen-Plus functions and imbedded FORTRAN. The DOE model was subsequently re-implemented using C++ for use in the workbench. Enhancements from the NETL fuel cell model include the ability to use coal derived syngas as the fuel gas, operate at elevated pressure, remove the fuel gas reformer (not needed for IGCC), and use more robust equation solvers.</p>
<p>This module is coded only to handle CO and H<sub>2</sub> coming into the anode as fuels.  This is 'hardwired' in both the thermal and electrical calculations.

The cathode 'air' stream, however, is <b>not</b> limited to just O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>. The cathode composition is arbritrary - the code just pulls off enough O<sub>2</sub> to react with the CO and H<sub>2</sub> entering in the anode stream at the specified fuel utilization level. </p>
