				<p>The Water Gas Shift Membrane Reactor simulates the conversion of the syngas 
					product of coal gasification to hydrogen fuel via the water gas shift reaction 
					(WGS):</p>
				<p><pre>     CO + H<sub>2</sub>O = CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>    </pre>
				<P></P>
				<p>The importance of this reaction lies in the ability to convert CO to H2, which 
					is valuable both as a fuel and as a chemical feedstock.</p>
				<p>The membrane reactor for WGS uses a two-zone catalytic, fixed-bed, reactor with 
					an integrated hydrogen selective membrane to convert the CO in cleaned syngas 
					to hydrogen. Compared to other possible configurations, the annular feed 
					configuration (see Figure at right) gave higher conversions for the same 
					reactor size, and this configuration is assumed in the model (Marigliano et. 
					al., 2001). Syngas enters and reacts on the feed-side of the membrane, and 
					hydrogen permeates to and is carried away by a sweep gas (typically nitrogen or 
					steam) on the permeate side of the membrane. A membrane reactor module would be 
					positioned after gas cleanup units and before fuel cells, combustors, or other 
					equipment which would process the hydrogen product gas.</p>
				<p>The MR is a one dimensional model that integrates the hydrogen flux across the 
					catalyst over the length of the unit. The integration is performed numerically 
					using a second order explicit predictor corrector method, and the adiabatic 
					equilibrium is computed locally from the feed gas enthalpy and composition. The 
					model assumes plug flow, with no axial dispersion.</p>
				<p>The hydrogen permeation rate is assumed to be the limiting process; chemical 
					reactions are assumed fast compared to hydrogen permeation. Thus, the feed gas 
					is assumed to be in chemical equilibrium, and all catalytic reaction 
					dependencies are ignored. This assumption has been used and validated in models 
					in the literature (Damle et. al. 1994), (Devarajan et. al. 1991). Only chemical 
					equilibrium for the water gas shift reaction is assumed, all other species are 
					assumed inert. This option simplifies the solution procedure and, more 
					importantly, allows reasonable computation times.</p>
				<p>It is important to note that the membrane reactor only works so long as there is 
					a hydrogen partial pressure driving force. Once the feed side hydrogen pressure 
					matches that of the sweep gas, the WGS reaction is limited by the equilibrium 
					composition. The primary purpose of the sweep gas is to dilute the hydrogen 
					enough to provide a sufficient driving force over the membrane, hence allowing 
					high CO conversion. A feed-to-permeate pressure ratio of 15 atmospheres is 
					typical (Bracht et. al., 1997).</p>

			<td><p>The User Interface first asks the user to specify the method of module 
					calculation. <em>Evaluation Mode</em> (shown) allows the user to input existing 
					membrane geometries (<em>Diameter, Thickness, and Length</em>), and the module 
					will use these values to calculate the resultant CO conversion. To work 
					backwards, the <em>Design Mode</em> allows the user to specify a <em>Desired CO 
						Conversion</em>, and uses a user-specified <em>Diameter</em> and <em>Thickness</em>
					to determine the <em>Reactor Length</em> necessary to achieve the desired 
					conversion.</p>
				<img src="images/Membrane_Reactor_schematic2.gif" align="right">
				<p>To allow further flexibility, the model is configured with an option to simulate 
					the requirements of a staged operation in which the feed gas is first 
					introduced to a <em>Preshift</em> catalytic non-membrane <em>Reactor</em>, 
					cooled and then fed to the membrane reactor. A schematic of this option is 
					presented at right, taken from Bracht et. al. (1997). As equilibrium is assumed 
					with the aid of a catalyst, the pre-shift reactor is simply modeled as an 
					adiabatic equilibrium on the feed gas. The temperature of the gas is then 
					dropped to the user-specified <em>M.R. inlet temp</em>, with the required heat 
					duty computed and displayed in the summary window below.</p>
				<p>In addition, the user can specify the H<sub>2</sub>O to CO ratio when the <em>Specify 
						H2O:CO</em> option is toggled.</p>
