      <td><p> This model provides a general purpose homogeneous gas phase kinetics integration capability. This allows for the effect of finite rate quench on the water-gas shift reaction occurring in the gasifier syngas to be calculated. Currently, only GRI Mech 3.0 is available as the detailed kinetic mechanism. The model has three modes of operation, two PFR modes and the PSR mode. The first PFR mode is the constant pressure variable temperature option. In this mode the temperature is integrated adiabatically or a heat loss may be specified. In the second mode the user inputs a linear temperature profile to simulate the effect of quench. These first two modes work as a PFR calculation. The third mode is a PSR calculation. </p></td>

<p> In the PFR mode, the residence time is a required input. In the PFR TTIM mode the quench rate is an additional input. In the PSR mode, the residence time and volumetric heat loss are required inputs.</p>
