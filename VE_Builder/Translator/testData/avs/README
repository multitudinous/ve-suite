In the avs file "2D.avs", vertex numbering begins with 1 and there are gaps in
the vertex numbering -- missing vertices 6,7,10,16,18. 

Every defined vertex has a corresponding solution -- as REQUIRED by avs format.

There are some extra unused vertices (8,9,11,19,20) in both the vertex section
and the solution section that are not used by the cell definitions -- These
should be automatically excluded from the flowdata.vtk.

To test the translator, enter:
   'translateToVtk 1 2D.avs'

Go with the default options (no scaling or transformation, and write all
parameters to the output file.  To compare your output to the gold standard,
type:
   'diff 2D.vtk flowdata.vtk'
   
The diff program should show no differences.

To examine the output file as ascii text or to compare between ascii versions,
use the utility:
   'convertVTK2Ascii flowdata.vtk flowdata.vtk'

Then do a diff:
   'diff 2DASCII.vtk flowdata.vtk'
   
The diff program should show no differences.
