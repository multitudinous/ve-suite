This project shows how to use the HDFToVTK class.
Currently it only supports David Clarke's data files, but
can easily be extended to read general HDF4 and HDF5 files.
To build the project, hdf2vtk.build.bat must be editted to
match the local build environment. HDF libraries require
zlib,szip, and jpeglib so these must also be downloaded locally.

LD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to be modified to point to HDF librarys 
HDF4_HOME and HDF5_HOME need to be set to build.
