This dir contains two translators, mfxi and fluent, that were submitted
to VE-Suite by Brian Dotson at the National Energy Technology Laboratory. 

They can be utilized in VE-Suite by adding them to the VTK/IO dir and adding 
them to the CMakeLists.txt file in the VTK/IO dir. Add the cxx filenames
to the SET( Kit_SRCS block in the CMakeLists.txt file.

Report any problems related to these translators to the VE-Suite bugzilla 
webpage.
