To Make stand alone CD for VE_Suite:

1.  Copy the contents of the VE_Suite_CD directory into a folder.
2.  Add the models you wish to have on the CD to the folder.
3.  Write the contents of the folder onto a CD.

The models can be put anywhere on the CD, but the recommended location is:

<root>\VE_Suite.1.0.3\exampleDatasets

This keeps the models in the same location as the sample data sets.

REMINDER:  Ensure that the contents of the folder will fit on a CD before writing!
