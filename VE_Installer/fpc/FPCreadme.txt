NOTE: To have scons's flagpoll work properly, you will need to install the latest version of flagpoll here:
https://realityforge.vrsource.org/view/FlagPoll/FlagpollDownloads

And add this line to your .cshrc file:
setenv FLAGPOLL_PATH *Insert path to this directory here*

gmtl now includes a pc file in the distro so shoudl be added the the flagpoll path
